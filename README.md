## Introduction

Welcome to this repository. This repository contains my code repository in a project related to Topic Modeling. 

Keep in mind that this is an unfinished project. It contains code only. Please expect the following updates to this repository:

1. Documentation
2. A deployed web app in Heroku

## Data Source

The data used in this project is **scraped** from [Amazon India's website](https://www.amazon.in). The data used is review data of iPhone XR obtained from [this page](https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-XR-64GB-White/dp/B07JGXM9WN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_bdcrb_top?ie=UTF8).

## Skills Demonstrated

1. Data Scraping / Crawling (Using BeautifulSoup)
2. Data Visualization (Using Matplotlib & Plotly)
3. Data Cleaning (Using Pandas & Numpy)
4. NLP - Topic Modeling (Using gensim)
5. Object Oriented Programming (in Python)

## Acessing the Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks contains step by step procedure's in completing this project. It explains about my process thought and reasoning behind certain codes.

Please open the Jupyter Notebooks using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or by visiting the URLs listed below. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is required because some plots does not render outside [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)'s Python environment. If you insist in using a Python environment outside [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), you'll need to delete one code cell and rerun the Jupyter Notebook.
