## Accessing the Jupyter Notebooks

Please open the Jupyter Notebooks using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or by visiting the URLs listed below. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is required because some plots does not render outside [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)'s Python environment. If you insist in using a Python environment outside [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), you'll need to delete one code cell and rerun the Jupyter Notebook.
